RLTS-Decentralization

## Description

The Red List of Threatened Species built on IPFS/Filecoin, and will use NFT technology and on-chain data proof to complete a permanent and permanent world ecology built on IPFS/Filecoin .

## Why should I make it?
Over 41,000 species are now facing extinction at https://www.iucnredlist.org/, but this is still 28% of all assessed species.

Although there is simple information on almost all species on  https://www.iucnredlist.org/ and information on Wikipedia, the data is relatively scattered and cannot obtain enough species information in the same place.

When people need to understand these species, they can only obtain very little information through these platforms, so that these people cannot deeply understand the origin of the species and the cause of extinction, and it is impossible to effectively carry out species analysis for us and our descendants. Ecological education can't induce human's protection of species from the depths.

We hope that anyone will be able to obtain detailed information on any species on our platform, including introductions, pictures, videos, documentaries and various information provided by people.

We hope that anyone can know from here the origin, experience, living state, cause of extinction  of each species

Therefore, we plan to build this platform, and eventually establish an ecological protection DAO, and use the web3 method to make some contributions to the ecology

## Who should make it?
Everyone should be involved. This one is hard.
But I want to start doing this, I just wish I could leave a detailed "epitaph" for the species that live together on this planet.

## who I am ï¼Ÿ
Internet researcher, web3 developer. Currently researching in the field of web3, I want to make some changes in this world through web3 technology.

I have nothing to do with RLTS, just an ordinary web3 resident who wants to make some personal contributions to the ecology.

## Usage

```
#github url 
https://github.com/rltsonweb3/rlts

# all rlts data
https://github.com/rltsonweb3/rlts/blob/main/rlts_data.csv

# rlts data crawler
https://github.com/rltsonweb3/rlts/tree/main/rlts-crawler

# rlts website
https://github.com/rltsonweb3/rlts/tree/main/rlts-website
```
The project is in progress and the upload of data through nft.storage is limited by the speed of the sdk, which is very slow. Website is also under construction .
